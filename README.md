# Data Analysis and Visualization Streamlit App

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive **data analysis and visualization application** built using **Streamlit** and **Python**. It provides insightful visualizations and trends for engagement patterns, course completion, student enrolments, and other related metrics.

The app integrates multiple datasets, processes the data, and presents meaningful visualizations using libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It allows for an easy-to-use interface where users can interact with the data and explore trends, insights, and recommendations over time.

## Features

- **Engagement Patterns by Course and Demographics**: Visualizes average engagement over time based on user demographics.
- **Feedback Ratings Comparison**: Compares and tracks feedback ratings across courses.
- **Trends Over Time**: Displays trends for engagement, course completion, and student enrolments.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provides data-driven insights and action points based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, etc.).
- **Seaborn**: For generating statistical graphics.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Python 3.x**: The main programming language used for analysis and backend logic.
